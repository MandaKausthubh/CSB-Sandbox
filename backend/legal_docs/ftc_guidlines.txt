The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) requires that advertising claims be truthful, evidence-based, and not misleading.

Key Principles:
- Claims about performance, health benefits, safety, or results must be supported by scientific evidence.
- Disclaimers must be clear, easy to understand, and placed close to the claim.
- Influencer endorsements must disclose material connections such as payment, gifts, or sponsorship.
- Required disclosures include clear statements like “#ad”, “Sponsored”, “Paid Partnership”.
- Advertisements must not exaggerate results or imply that results are typical without stating so.
- Health claims cannot imply disease treatment, cures, or medical outcomes unless medically verified.
- Testimonials must reflect real and typical experience or must clearly disclose what typical results are.
- Ads must not target vulnerable groups, including children, with deceptive content.
- Omitted information that would affect consumer decisions may count as misleading.

Violations include:
- False health or performance claims
- Hidden sponsorships or endorsements
- Misleading before-and-after images
- Deceptive product comparisons
- Implying professional endorsement without authorization
