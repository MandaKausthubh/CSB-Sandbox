The EU Digital Services Act regulates online platforms to ensure user safety, transparency, and accountability.

Key Principles:
- Illegal content must be removed promptly once identified or reported.
- Platforms must provide mechanisms to report harmful or unlawful content.
- Misinformation related to public safety, elections, and health may trigger enhanced moderation.
- Targeted advertising based on sensitive personal data (religion, health, sexual orientation) is restricted.
- Platforms must disclose when content is paid, boosted, or sponsored.
- Recipients of commercial content must be able to identify the advertiser.

Risk Obligations for Large Platforms:
- Assess and mitigate risks related to:
  - The spread of illegal content
  - Harmful manipulation (disinformation, deepfakes)
  - Protection of minors
  - Threats to public health or safety

Content Ranking Transparency:
- Platforms must explain how recommendations and algorithms work.
- Users must be offered non-profile-based recommendation options.

Penalties:
- Violations can lead to fines up to 6% of global annual revenue.
